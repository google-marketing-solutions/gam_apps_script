# GAM SCRIPT

This project provides a lightweight client-library for working with the Ad
Manager API in Apps Script environments. The library generates the proper SOAP
payload for each request and automatically parses the response, building on
previous solutions that require building requests by hand. The library is
written in TypeScript.
